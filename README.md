# Manual-Testing
**Hi! I put here the results of my work collected during learning manual software testing.** <br>
The *Certificates* folder contains certificates confirming participation in various courses that allowed me to learn about tools and technologies useful to the tester in his work. Recently, I have been participating in the QualityIsland internship project, thanks to which I have taken part in intensive training in ISTQB, databases, SQL language and API testing. I have performed acceptance tests of the web application, created test cases and test scenarios, reported bugs and worked with design documentation.
In the *Test cases* folder there are test cases that I created and which I wrote, among others, for my "Currency-calculator" and "To-Do-List" projects in TestLink, qTest and TestRail.
The *Bug reports* folder contains sample bug reports that I created in Jira based on the knowledge gained during the courses and on the basis of specialist literature.
The *SQL* and *API testing* folders contain projects and exercises that I performed in PostgreSQL and Postman.
In the folder *CV* there is my current CV :)
