# Manual-Testing
Hi! I put here the results of my work collected during learning manual software testing.
The “Certificates” folder contains certificates confirming participation in courses on the Udemy platform, among others. Recently, I have been participating in the QualityIsland internship project, thanks to which I have already taken part in intensive training in databases, SQL language and API testing.
In the “Test cases” folder there are test cases that I created and which I wrote, among others, for my "Currency-calculator" and "To-Do-List" projects in TestLink, qTest and TestRail.
The “Bug reports” folder contains sample bug reports that I created in Jira based on the knowledge gained during the courses and on the basis of specialist literature.
The “SQL” and “API testing” folders contain projects and exercises that I performed in PostgreSQL and Postman.
In the folder "CV" there is my current CV :)
