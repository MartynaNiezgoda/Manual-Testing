# Manual-Testing
**Hi! I put here the results of my work collected during learning manual software testing and working as manual tester currently.** <br>
The *Certificates* folder contains certificates confirming participation in various courses that allowed me to learn about tools and technologies useful for the tester in his work. Recently, I have obtained the ISTQB Certificate - Foundation Level.<br>
In the *Test cases* folder there are test cases that I created and which I wrote, among others, for my "Currency-calculator" and "To-Do-List" projects in TestLink, qTest and TestRail.<br>
The *Bug reports* folder contains sample bug reports that I created in Jira based on the knowledge gained during the courses and on the basis of specialist literature.<br>
In the *Inco Academy* folder there is documentation that I created while participating in the "Get Into QA" Course. It consists of a web application test report, test cases and bug reports.<br>
The *SQL* and *API testing* folders contain projects and exercises that I performed in PostgreSQL and Postman.<br>
In the folder *CV* there is my current CV :)
